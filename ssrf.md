## Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The Web's Hidden Proxy

**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** is a cunning vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate a web application into making requests to internal or external resources on their behalf. Imagine a hacker using a web application as a puppet, forcing it to fetch sensitive data or perform actions that it shouldn't.

### Understanding SSRF: The Basics

SSRF vulnerabilities arise when a web application fetches a remote resource without properly validating the user-supplied input that specifies the resource location. This allows attackers to craft malicious requests that can bypass firewalls, access internal services, or even execute code on the server.

### The Anatomy of an SSRF Attack

- **User Input**: The attacker provides a URL or other identifier as input to the web application, specifying a resource to be fetched.
- **Unvalidated Input**: The web application fails to properly validate or sanitize the input, allowing the attacker to control the target of the request.
- **Server-Side Request**: The web application makes a request to the attacker-supplied URL on behalf of the server.
- **Attacker's Gain**: The attacker can now access resources that are normally inaccessible from the outside, such as internal services, backend APIs, or cloud metadata endpoints.

---

### Types of SSRF Attacks

- **Basic SSRF**: The attacker can access any publicly accessible resource on the internet.
- **Blind SSRF**: The attacker cannot see the response of the server-side request, but can still infer information based on the application's behavior.
- **SSRF with Authentication Bypass**: The attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms to access restricted resources.
- **SSRF to Localhost**: The attacker can access services running on the same server as the web application.
- **SSRF to Cloud Metadata Endpoints**: The attacker can access sensitive information stored in cloud metadata services.

### Impact of SSRF Attacks

- **Port Scanning**: Attackers can scan internal networks to discover open ports and services.
- **Service Discovery**: Attackers can identify internal services that are not meant to be exposed to the internet.
- **Information Disclosure**: Attackers can access sensitive data, such as configuration files, source code, or internal APIs.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: In some cases, attackers can leverage SSRF to execute arbitrary code on the server.

### Identifying and Exploiting SSRF Vulnerabilities

#### Manual Testing:
- Look for functionalities that fetch remote resources based on user input (e.g., image fetching, URL previews, webhooks).
- Try injecting different URLs to see if the application makes requests to them.
- Look for ways to bypass filters and WAFs (Web Application Firewalls).

#### Automated Scanning:
- Use web vulnerability scanners like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to automate the process of finding SSRF vulnerabilities.

#### Example Payloads:
```plaintext
http://localhost/admin
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

#### Mitigating SSRF Attacks

- **Whitelist Allowed URLs**: Only allow requests to a pre-approved list of safe URLs.
- **Validate User Input**: Sanitize and validate all user-supplied input that is used to fetch remote resources.
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate internal services from the internet to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Disable Unused Protocols**: Disable protocols that are not needed by the application, such as `gopher://` or `file://`.
