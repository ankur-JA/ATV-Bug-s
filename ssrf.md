**Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The Web's Hidden Proxy**

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a cunning vulnerability that allows attackers to manipulate a web application into making requests to internal or external resources on their behalf. Imagine a hacker using a web application as a puppet, forcing it to fetch sensitive data or perform actions that it shouldn't.

**Understanding SSRF: The Basics**

SSRF vulnerabilities arise when a web application fetches a remote resource without properly validating the user-supplied input that specifies the resource location. This allows attackers to craft malicious requests that can bypass firewalls, access internal services, or even execute code on the server.

**The Anatomy of an SSRF Attack**

    - **User Input**: The attacker provides a URL or other identifier as input to the web application, specifying a resource to be fetched.
    - **Unvalidated Input**: The web application fails to properly validate or sanitize the input, allowing the attacker to control the target of the request.
    - **Server-Side Request**: The web application makes a request to the attacker-supplied URL on behalf of the server.
    - **Attacker's Gain**: The attacker can now access resources that are normally inaccessible from the outside, such as internal services, backend APIs, or cloud metadata endpoints.

**Types of SSRF Attacks**

    **1. Basic SSRF:** The attacker can access any publicly accessible resource on the internet.
    **2. Blind SSRF:** The attacker cannot see the response of the server-side request, but can still infer information based on the application's behavior.
    **3. SSRF with Authentication Bypass:** The attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms to access restricted resources.
    **4. SSRF to Localhost:** The attacker can access services running on the same server as the web application.
    **5. SSRF to Cloud Metadata Endpoints:** The attacker can access sensitive information stored in cloud metadata services.

**Impact of SSRF Attacks**

SSRF attacks can have severe consequences, including:

    **○ Port Scanning:** Attackers can scan internal networks to discover open ports and services.
    **○ Service Discovery:** Attackers can identify internal services that are not meant to be exposed to the internet.
    **○ Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive data, such as configuration files, source code, or internal APIs.
    **○ Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some cases, attackers can leverage SSRF to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Identifying and Exploiting SSRF Vulnerabilities**

    **Manual Testing:**
        ○ Look for functionalities that fetch remote resources based on user input (e.g., image fetching, URL previews, webhooks).
        ○ Try injecting different URLs to see if the application makes requests to them.
        ○ Look for ways to bypass filters and WAFs (Web Application Firewalls).
**    Automated Scanning:**
        ○ Use web vulnerability scanners like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to automate the process of finding SSRF vulnerabilities.

**Example Payloads:**

http://localhost/admin
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

**Mitigating SSRF Attacks**

    **○ Whitelist Allowed URLs:** Only allow requests to a pre-approved list of safe URLs.
    **○ Validate User Input:** Sanitize and validate all user-supplied input that is used to fetch remote resources.
    **○ Network Segmentation:** Isolate internal services from the internet to prevent unauthorized access.
    **○ Disable Unused Protocols:** Disable protocols that are not needed by the application, such as gopher or file://.

**Testing Methodology:**

**    1. Identify Potential Entry Points:**
        ● Look for functionalities that involve fetching data from remote resources. This includes features like:
            ○ Image processing or resizing services that fetch images from user-provided URLs.
            ○ Content aggregation services that fetch articles or news from external sources.
            ○ File download functionalities that allow users to provide a URL.
            ○ Webhooks or APIs that accept URLs as input.
            ○ Social media integrations that fetch data from external platforms.
            ○ XML parsers or other services that process data from remote sources.

**    2. Craft SSRF Payloads:**
**        ● Basic SSRF:**
            ○ Replace the original URL with a URL pointing to a server you control:

            http://your-server.com/test.txt

            Observe if your server receives a request from the target application's IP address.
**        ● Blind SSRF:**
            ○ If you can't see the response directly, try using a service like Burp Collaborator or Interactsh to capture out-of-band interactions.
            ○ Send a request to a Burp Collaborator URL and see if the target application interacts with it.
**        ● SSRF to Localhost/Internal Network:**
            ○ Replace the original URL with a URL pointing to localhost or an internal IP address:

            http://localhost/admin
            http://127.0.0.1:8080/
            http://192.168.0.1/

            Look for responses that reveal internal services or information.
**        ● SSRF to Cloud Metadata Endpoints:**
            ○ Replace the original URL with the cloud provider's metadata endpoint:

            http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

            If vulnerable, the application might leak sensitive information like access keys or instance IDs.

**    3. Bypass Techniques:**
 **       ○ URL Encoding:** Encode special characters in the URL to bypass filters.
   **     ○ Alternative IP Representations: **Use decimal, octal, or hexadecimal representations of IP addresses to bypass filters.
 **       ○ DNS Rebinding: **Use a domain that resolves to different IP addresses over time to bypass restrictions based on domain names.

**Real-World Examples:**

 **   ● Image Processing Service: **An image processing service allows users to upload images from URLs. An attacker could provide a URL pointing to an internal server, potentially revealing sensitive files or configurations.
 **   ● Webhooks:** A webhook functionality allows users to specify a URL to be notified of events. An attacker could provide a URL pointing to an internal API endpoint, triggering actions or leaking data.
**    ● XML Parser: **An XML parser that fetches external entities could be exploited to read local files or make requests to internal services.

**Tools:**

 **   ● Burp Suite:** Use Burp Suite's proxy and repeater features to intercept and modify requests.
 **   ● SSRFmap: **An automated SSRF fuzzing tool.
**    ● Kiterunner:** Another automated SSRF testing tool.
 **   ● ffuf:** A fast web fuzzer for finding hidden parameters and endpoints.

Always test for SSRF vulnerabilities in a safe and controlled environment. Never exploit vulnerabilities on systems you don't have permission to test.
